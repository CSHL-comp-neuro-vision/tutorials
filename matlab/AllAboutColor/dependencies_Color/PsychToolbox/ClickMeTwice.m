% Congratulations. You've successfully used "PsychToolbox Install" to% install the Psychophysics Toolbox.% % Now that you're running MATLAB, tell it to update its path to include% the new Psychophysics Toolbox folder. First bring MATLAB's Command% window forward, by hitting Cmd-0 (i.e. hit the zero key while holding% down the apple-cloverleaf key). Then select "Set Path" from the File menu.% (It's annoying, but the "Set Path" item won't appear unless the Command % window is frontmost.) In the "MATLAB Path" window that opens, hit the % "Default Path" button. Wait for the watch cursor to revert to an arrow. % Now hit the "Save" button, which saves the new path to disk and dismisses % the window.% % To start playing with the Psychophysics Toolbox, do this:help PsychToolbox % triple-click this line and hit <enter>% You're now done with this window; click the close box in the upper left.% % Have fun% % David Brainard & Denis Pelli
