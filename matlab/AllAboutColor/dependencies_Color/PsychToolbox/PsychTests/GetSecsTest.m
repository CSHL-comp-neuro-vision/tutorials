function GetSecsTest% GetSecsTest adjusts the time-advancement rate of GetSecs to match% that of GetTicks, i.e. the standard Macintosh 60.15 Hz tick counter.% The Apple-default rate for GetSecs is generally accurate to about% 10^-2. GetTicks, which is the time base for the time of day, seems% to be accurate to within a few minutes a month, ie 10^-4.% GetSecsTest adjusts the multiplier in the VideoToolbox Seconds.c to% match the two rates to within 10^-4. You could time more ticks to% achieve a better match, but I don't think the absolute accuracy of% the tick counter warrants matching any more closely. Note that the% SecondsMultiplier value is specific to the machine it was measured% on.% % If it is important to your application to have time advance at the% same rate every time you run MATLAB, then you may wish to compute% this SecondsMultiplier only once, and to create a script that loads% that specific value into the SCREEN Preference SecondsMultiplier,% and to run that script at the beginning of every session. Note that% this multiplier has no effect on the internal counter; it merely% affects the conversion of the count to a time.% % SCREEN Preference SecondsMultiplier stores the new value in the% PsychTable, which persists until you quit MATLAB. (It's not affected% by MATLAB'S CLEAR.)%% See Apple's "Technical Q&A HW31 - UpTime's values are consistently slow?"% web http://developer.apple.com/qa/hw/hw31.html%% See TimingTest.% 2/18/99	dgp Wrote it.% 3/15/99	dgp Use the result to set SecondsMultiplier.% 3/19/99	dgp Polished.% 4/20/99	dgp Not affected by CLEAR.% 12/22/99	dgp Added link to Apple's note on UpTime's slowness.clear s ss mwaitticks(0);getsecs;s=zeros(1,20);for j=1:4	for i=1:length(s)		waitticks(1);		s(i)=getsecs;	end	ss=sort(diff(s));	n=3;	m(j)=mean(ss((1+n):(end-n)))*60.15;	% discard n largest and smallest valuesendfprintf('Timed %g ticks.
