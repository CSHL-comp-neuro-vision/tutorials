function PixelSizeTest% WARNING! THIS MAY CRASH!% PixelSizeTest repeatedly uses SCREEN('OpenWindow') to test every% screen at every depth, i.e. pixelSize. Repeatedly changing depth% used to crash Mac OS 7, before 7.6. It works fine now on all Macs% tested to date (G3, Powerbook G3 Series, and 6100), if MATLAB's% Backgrounding is off. If Backgrounding is on, then PixelSizeTest% crashes David's PowerMac running Mac OS 8.1 and my PowerBook G3% series running Mac OS 8.6. PixelSizeTest runs fine on my PowerMac% 6100 running Mac OS 8.6 and no foreign INITs, whether or not% Backgrounding is enabled. PixelSizeTest crashed reliably on my PowerMac 6100% running Mac OS 8.1 when it had all my% then-favorite INITs; PixelSizeTest ran fine when only Apple's INITs% were present. (I don't recall whether Backgrounding was on during% that test).%% Denis Pelli% 4/8/98 dgp wrote it% 5/23/99 dgp Mention conflict with Backgrounding.% 6/2/99 dgp Add David's report, which indicates that the conflict is with Backgrounding, not%            any particular version of the Mac OS.% 6/10/99 dgp Add 6100 Mac OS 8.6 report.% 2/4/00  dgp  Updated for Mac OS 9.help PixelSizeTestDescribeComputer;if SCREEN('Preference','Backgrounding')	warning('MATLAB Backgrounding is on.
