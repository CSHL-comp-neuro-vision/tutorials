% PsychToolbox:PsychDemos.%% help PsychToolbox % For an overview, triple-click me & hit enter.%% These demos show how to use the Psychophysics Toolbox. Run a demo,% see what it does, and then look at the code: e.g. type "edit moviedemo"% to look at MovieDemo.m.% % ScreenDemo is a good first choice. It demonstrates much of the basic% functionality.% % MovieDemo is very simple, yet demonstrates everything you need to show% arbitrary images, one per frame, at 75 Hz, or whatever rate your monitor% runs at.  (And run ScreenTest in PsychTests.)%%   BitPlaneDemo        - Use 8-bit frame buffer to hold 8 binary images.%   ClutMovieDemo       - Clut movie of flickering grating, gamma corrected.%   ColorGratingDemo    - Show a flickering full color grating.%   ContrastThreshDemo  - Measure contrast thresholds in noise.%   DialogDemo          - Use dialog box to get typed user response.%   GammaFlipDemo       - Flip screen gamma and clut.%   GetNumberDemo       - Get number or string from user.%   GratingDemo         - Display a grating, at any pixelSize.%   KbDemo              - Realtime keyboard monitoring, using KbCheck.%   MouseTraceDemo      - Track mouse around screen and draw contour.%   MovieDemo           - Make a movie.%   MovieDemo2          - Make a movie. A more elaborate example.%   MovieTearDemo       - Demonstrates the artifact called "tearing".%   OffscreenDemo       - Draw and copy on- and off-screen.%   PhaseDistortDemo    - Measure phase-distort. thresh. for face recognition.%   QTDem               - Demonstrate QT mex file.%   QuestDemo           - Simulate QUEST threshold measurement.%   RenderDemo          - Render CIE xyY as a color patch.%   ScreenDemo          - Show off some of SCREEN's many display functions.%   SimpleCalDemo       - Exercise the calibration routines.%   TextDemo            - Display text in all fonts and sizes.%   VisualGammaDemo     - Use visual matching to measure monitor's gamma.%   WindowDemo          - Move windows around.%   ZonePlateDemo       - View zone plate to assess monitor's gamma correction.% Copyright (c) 1996, 1997 by David Brainard & Denis Pelli
