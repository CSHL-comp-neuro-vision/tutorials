All data files are% in a standard format.  A very useful source for on-line% colorimetric data is the CVRL database: %   http://cvision.ucsd.edu/index.htm% Many of the functions used here were downloaded from% that source and then splined to the wavelength sampling% used here (with extension by zeros).%%   B_xxx files contain basis functions.  The basis functions themselves%     are in the columns of a matrix with name B_xxx.  There is also%     a 3 by 1 row vector S_xxx that contains the wavelength sampling%     information in the form [start delta numberSamples] where start%     and delta are in nanometers.%%   den_xxx files contain optical density data.  In log units.  To%     convert density values to transmittance, take 10^(-den).%%   spd_xxx files contain spectral power distributions.  Data are in%     columns of matrix with name spd_xxx.  There is also a S_xxx%     vector.%%   sur_xxx files contain surface reflectance functions (range 0-1).  Data%     are in columns of matrix with name sur_xxx.  There is also an S_xxx%     vector.%%   T_xxx contain color matching functions or spectral sensitivities.  Data%      are in rows of a matrix with name T_xxx.  There is also an S_xxx%      vector.%%  Specific data files are listed below.  All are sampled between 380 nm%  and 780 nm at 5 nm intervals (S = [380 5 81]).  In many cases, the%  original data were interpolated or extraploated (with zeros) to %  put the data onto this wavelength sampling basis.%%   B_cieday            - CIE daylight basis functions.%   B_cohen             - Cohens basis functions for Munsell surfaces.%   B_monitor           - Basis functions for a color monitor.%   B_nickerson         - Basis functions for Munsell surfaces.%   B_roomillum         - Basis functions for illuminants in Brainard's room.%   den_lens_ws         - Relative lens density data (re 700 nm).
