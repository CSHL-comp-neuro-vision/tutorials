% PsychToolbox.% Version 2.44        7 August 2000% % The Psychophysics Toolbox is a collection of MATLAB functions (M,% MEX, and DLL) that extend the language to give you exquisite control% of your computer to test observers with research-grade dynamic% stimuli.% % Every PsychToolbox function has its own documentation available% through the Matlab HELP command, and, in the case of MEX files,% through the function itself. We've tried hard to make these% individual bits of documentation clear, accurate, and complete.% (We're grateful to receive corrections.)% % We've mostly followed Mathworks's help-text conventions but note% that in our help text we designate optional arguments to function% calls by embracing them with square brackets. You're not meant to% include these brackets when you actually call the function. For% example, "help SND" will tell you this:%      err = SND(command,[sig],[rate])% meaning that the "command" argument is required and the "sig" and% "rate" arguments are optional. A typical call to SND looks like% this:%      SND('Play','Quack')% % Try these:%      help psychdemos       % For demos, triple-click me & hit enter.%      help psychbasic%      help screen%      screen openwindow?% % To read more, look at the "intro" and "docs" pages at the web site.% The web site also has advice about getting help, the PsychToolbox% forum, and the latest information about bugs and new releases:% web http://color.psych.ucsb.edu/psychtoolbox/; % triple-click me & hit enter% % If you want to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your% research, you might say something like this, "We wrote our experiments% in MATLAB, using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard, 1997; % Pelli, 1997)."% Brainard, D.H.
