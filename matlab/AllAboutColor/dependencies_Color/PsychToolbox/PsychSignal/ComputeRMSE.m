function rmse = ComputeRMSE(data,predict)% rmse = ComputeRMSE(data,predict)%% Compute fractional RMSE between data and prediction.% Inputs should be column vectors.% Actual code is:%		diff = predict-data;%		rmse = sqrt((diff'*diff)/(data'*data));%% 2/3/96		dhb		Added improved comments.diff = predict-data;rmse = sqrt((diff'*diff)/(data'*data));
