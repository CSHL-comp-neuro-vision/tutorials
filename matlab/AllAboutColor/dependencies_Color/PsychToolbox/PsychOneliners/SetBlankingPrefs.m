function SetBlankingPrefs(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)% SetBlankingPrefs(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)% % As of 7/15/98, this program is redundant, since it's already set% that way.% % The blanking prefs are set up automatically by SCREEN.mex,% internally, when you first use a screen, and they remain in effect% until you close all windows on that device. Usually SCREEN.mex makes% good choices for the blanking prefs.% % This file is intended as a way of implementing overrides of the% standard settings that we want to recommend to users that are having% trouble, but without imposing them on everyone because they're still% experimental. At the moment, the experiment that led to the creation% of this file has succeeded and the relevant changes have already% been folded into SCREEN.mex. So there is no reason to run this file.%% See DriverTest and ScreenTest.%% Denis Pelli 25 July 1998% HISTORY% 10/3/99 dgp updated to use DriverTest instead of FrameRate.if nargin~=1 | nargout~=0	error('Usage: SetBlankingPrefs(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)');enddriver=DriverTest(windowPtrOrScreenNumber);SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutDriverWaitsForBlanking',driver.setClutDriverAwaitsBlanking);SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutCallsWaitBlanking',~driver.setClutDriverAwaitsBlanking);
