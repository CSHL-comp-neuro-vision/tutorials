function black=BlackIndex(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)% color=BlackIndex(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)% Returns the CLUT index to produce black at the current screen depth,% assuming a standard color lookup table for that depth. E.g.% black=BlackIndex(w);% SCREEN(w,'FillRect',black);% % See WhiteIndex.% % When the screen is 1 to 8 bit mode, the Macintosh OS always makes the% first clut element white and the last black. In 16 or 32 bit mode the% clut goes from black to white. These CLUT conventions can be overridden% by SCREEN 'SetClut', which makes a direct call to the video driver,% bypassing the Mac OS, allowing you to impose any CLUT whatsoever.% 3/10/98	dgp Wrote it.% 3/30/98	dgp Consider only one channel, even for 16 and 32 bit modes.% 3/8/2000	emw Added platform conditional% 3/8/2000	dgp Fixed platform conditionalif strcmp(computer,'PCWIN')   black8=0;else   black8=255;endpixelSize=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'PixelSize');switch pixelSizecase 32;black=0;case 16;black=0;case 8;black=black8;case 4;black=15;case 2;black=3;case 1;black=1;end
