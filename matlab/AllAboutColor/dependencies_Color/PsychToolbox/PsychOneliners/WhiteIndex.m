function white=WhiteIndex(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)% color=WhiteIndex(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)% Returns the CLUT index to produce white at the current screen depth,% assuming a standard color lookup table for that depth. E.g.% white=WhiteIndex(w);% SCREEN(w,'FillRect',white);% % See BlackIndex.% % When the screen is 1 to 8 bit mode, the Macintosh OS always makes the% first clut element white and the last black. In 16 or 32 bit mode the% clut goes from black to white. These CLUT conventions can be overridden% by SCREEN 'SetClut', which makes a direct call to the video driver,% bypassing the Mac OS, allowing you to impose any CLUT whatsoever.% 3/10/98	dgp Wrote it.% 3/30/98	dgp Consider only one channel, even for 16 and 32 bit modes.% 3/8/2000  emw Added Platform Conditionals% 3/8/2000	dgp Fixed platform conditionalsif strcmp(computer,'PCWIN')   white8=255;else   white8=0;endpixelSize=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'PixelSize');switch pixelSizecase 32;white=255;case 16;white=31;case 8;white=white8;case 4;white=0;case 2;white=0;case 1;white=0;end
