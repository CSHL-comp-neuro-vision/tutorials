function s0 = ComputeDiffLimit(pupil,wlnm)% s0 = ComputeDiffLimit(pupil,wlnm)%% Compute the diffraction limit for coherent light.% See page 120 in Goodman.  The formula involves% di.  I think that this is the distance to the% image and that the formula gives the limit in% cycles/unit length.  The formula below gives% the answer in cycles/degree.% % 	pupil size in mm% 	wavelength in nm% 	s0 in cycles/deg%% 7/11/94		dhb		Added this comment.NM_TO_MM = 1.0e-6; DEG_TO_RAD = (2.0*pi)/360.0;s0 = (pupil/(2.0*wlnm*NM_TO_MM))*tan(1.0*DEG_TO_RAD);
