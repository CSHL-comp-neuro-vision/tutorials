function PatchTrap(name,seconds);% PatchTrap(name,[seconds])%% PatchTrap is a MEX function that temporarily disables any of several% Apple Macintosh traps: GetNextEvent, WaitNextEvent, EventAvail, PrimeTime.% The patch is a no-op, returning immediately instead of calling the% original routine. All the traps are automatically re-enabled once the% specified number of seconds elapse. You can reenable the traps sooner % by calling PatchTrap with zero "seconds". If not specified, the default% number of "seconds" is 5.%% PatchTrap is a way to temporarily suspend processing of external events% as a way of speeding things up. MATLAB's Backgrounding uses WaitNextEvent% to give up time to other processes; this can be temporarily% disabled by calling PatchTrap('WaitNextEvent').%% The main purpose in creating this function was to work around a bug in% MATLAB 5.0, which was fixed in MATLAB 5.1. MATLAB 5.0 makes a spurious% call to GetMenuBar before each call to any MEX, which wastes 0.4 ms% every time, and leaks 64 bytes of memory. Using PatchTrap to substitute% a dummy routine for GetMenuBar eliminates the bug.% 	PatchTrap('GetMenuBar',2)%	... do time-critical stuff ...% 	PatchTrap('GetMenuBar',0)% NOTE: Student MATLAB is still at version 5.0, and has the bug.% WARNING: MATLAB crashes if you click the debug icon in the editor window% toolbar while 'GetMenuBar' is patched.% HISTORY:% 	4/9/97	dgp	Wrote it% 	4/10/97	dgp	Renamed from IgnoreEvents to PatchTrap.% 	6/4/97	dgp	Added warning about patching GetMenuBar.% 	2/28/98	dgp	Updated comments about MATLAB 5.0 and 5.1.
