CAUTION: moves memory!% % The FreeMem function returns the total amount of free memory in the current heap. % Because these bytes might be dispersed throughout memory, it is ordinarily not % possible to allocate a single contiguous block of that size.% % "The TempFreeMem function returns the total amount of free temporary memory that % you could allocate by calling TempNewHandle. The returned value is the total % number of free bytes. Because these bytes might be dispersed throughout memory, % it is ordinarily not possible to allocate a single relocatable block of that size."% % "The MaxBlock function returns the maximum contiguous space, in bytes, that you % could obtain after compacting the current heap zone. MaxBlock does not actually % do the compaction."% % "The StackSpace function returns the current amount of stack space (in bytes) % ... at the instant of return from the trap. Ordinarily, you determine the maximum % amount of stack space you need before you ship your application. In general, % therefore, this routine is useful only during debugging to determine how big to % make the stack. However, if your application calls a recursive function that % conceivably could call itself many times, that function should keep track of the % stack space and take appropriate action if it becomes too low."% % "The MaxMem function compacts the current heap zone and purges all relocatable, % unlocked, and purgeable blocks from the zone. It returns the size, in bytes, of % the largest contiguous free block in the zone after the compacting and purging."% % "The TempMaxMem function compacts the current heap zone and returns the size of % the largest contiguous block available for temporary allocation." % % (source: Apple's Mac Programmer's Toolbox Assistant QuickView database.)% % HISTORY:% 	1/20/97	dgp	wrote it
