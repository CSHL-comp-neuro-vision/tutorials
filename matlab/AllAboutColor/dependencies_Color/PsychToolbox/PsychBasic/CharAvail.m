function avail = CharAvail% avail = CharAvail% % Return 1 if a character is available in the event queue, 0 if not. Note% that this routine leaves the character in the queue.  Call GetChar to% remove the character from the event queue.% Macintosh:% 	Command-Period always causes an immediate exit.% % 	GetChar and CharAvail are character-oriented (and slow), whereas KbCheck% 	and KbWait are keypress-oriented (and fast). See KbCheck.%% 	WARNING: When BACKGROUNDING is enabled, MATLAB removes all% 	characters from the event queue before executing each MATLAB% 	statement, so CharAvail and EventAvail('keyDown') always report 0.% 	So turn off BACKGROUNDING:% % 	SCREEN('Preference','Backgrounding',0); % Until MATLAB 5.2.1, this call required a disk access, which is slow.% % Windows:%	CharAvail does not work reliably. Matlab seems to steal WM_CHAR messages from the queue. %	Use ButtonAvail instead. % See also: EventAvail, GetChar, KbCheck, KbWait, KbDemo, SCREEN Preference Backgrounding.% 11/5/94 dhb	Added caveat about delay.% 1/22/97 dhb	Added comment and pointer to TIMER routines.% 3/6/97  dhb	Updated for KbWait, KbCheck.% 8/2/97  dgp	Explain difference between key and character.
