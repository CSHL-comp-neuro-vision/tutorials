function HideCursor% HideCursor%% HideCursor.mex hides the cursor. Note that the Mac OS counts the% number of times you call HideCursor (up to 255), and requires an% equal number of calls to ShowCursor before the cursor becomes% visible again. Excess calls to ShowCursor are ignored. (When SCREEN% closes its last window it calls ShowCursor 255 times.) % % Flushing HideCursor.mex (eg "CLEAR HIDECURSOR" or "CLEAR MEX") makes the % cursor visible.% % WARNING: When BACKGROUNDING is enabled, MATLAB shows the cursor % before executing each MATLAB statement, even if you just called% HideCursor. So turn off BACKGROUNDING:% % SCREEN('Preference','Backgrounding',0); % Until MATLAB 5.2.1, this accessed the disk, which is slow.%% See ShowCursor, SCREEN Preference Backgrounding.% 7/23/97 dgp Added wish.% 8/15/97 dgp Explain hide/show counter.% 3/27/99 dgp Mention Backgrounding.% 3/28/99 dgp Show how to turn off backgrounding. % 1/22/00 dgp Cosmetic.
