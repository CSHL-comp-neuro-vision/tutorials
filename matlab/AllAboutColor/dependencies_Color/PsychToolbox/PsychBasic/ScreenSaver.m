function [wasSaveEnabled,wasDimEnabled]=ScreenSaver([enableSave,enableDim])% [wasSaveEnabled,wasDimEnabled]=ScreenSaver([enableSave,enableDim])% % ScreenSaver.mex controls AfterDark-compatible screen savers as well% as Apple's Energy Saver screen dimming, allowing you to disable or% enable screen saving and dimming. Most screen savers are% AfterDark-compatible.% % Please note that it's necessary to distinguish between "saving" and% "dimming", even though both may look the same to you. Non-Apple% companies have created a variety of screen "saving" programs that% are (nearly) all controlled through one protocol. Apple provides an% Energy Saver control panel that allows you to specify that the% screen should be dimmed after a specified idle time. This is% controlled through an entirely different mechanism.% % Usually you'll want to save both states, as you set both to 0 and% begin your experiment, and then restore both states when you're% done. ScreenSaver makes that very easy to do.% % All the input and output arguments can only have values 0 (false)% and 1 (true). Screen saving or dimming may not be available, in% which case they are considered to be off.% % IMPORTANT: Note that as a result of a 9/99 enhancement to% SCREEN.mex, you probably don't need to use ScreenSaver at all.% SCREEN now automatically disables screen savers while it has% onscreen windows open.% % NOTE: If you use the screen saver Sleeper (as we do), please use% version 3.2.1 or better, as in earlier versions the "Power down% monitor" mode could not be enabled/disabled by another process.% web http://www.stclairsoft.com/Sleeper/% % ScreenSaver.mex is an enhanced replacement for the obsolete% AfterDark.m. Please update your programs. In most cases you'll want% to simply eliminate the call.% % NOTE: The AfterDark 4.03 screen saver seems to be incompatible with% Mac OS 9, e.g. AfterDark crashes when you close its control panel.% This isn't too surprising since After Dark hasn't been updated% since 1997. Instead, we recommend using the Energy Saver included% in the Mac OS, which will save power as well as your screen. Or use% Sleeper (link below), which is updated frequently and seems to be% compatible with everything.% % According to Rene Ros's Gestalt Selectors List, the following% screen savers are AfterDark-compatible:% AfterDark by Berkeley Systems, Inc.% Arashi by Juri Munkki% Basic Black by Mason L.
