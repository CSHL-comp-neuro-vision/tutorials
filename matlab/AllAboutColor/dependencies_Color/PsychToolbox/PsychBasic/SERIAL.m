% SERIAL.mex allows you to send and receive data through the Macintosh% serial ports. It's part of the Psychophysics Toolbox.% % SERIAL has multiple functions. The basic operation is to open a% port, use it to read and write, and then close it.  For example:% %   portA = SERIAL('Open','.Ain','.Aout',9600)%   SERIAL('Write',portA,['Hello world.' 13]);%   SERIAL('Close',portA);% % will write the string "Hello world" followed by a carriage return to% the A (modem) serial port at 9600 baud.% % You select which port to open by specifying the names of its% input and output drivers. %   ports=SERIAL('Ports')% will list all your ports. The most common ports are these:%      Modem:   '.Ain', '.Aout'%      Printer: '.Bin', '.Bout'% If you add a card with additional serial ports, each port will have% its own unique driver names. The Tips web site, below, recommends % suppliers of such cards, including a serial port for the Blue & % White G3.% % web http://vision.nyu.edu/Tips/HowTo.html#UseSerial% % Get a list of SERIAL's functions by typing SERIAL alone at the % MATLAB prompt. Get help on any particular function by calling % SERIAL with the function name followed by '?'.  For example, % either of these equivalent calls,%      SERIAL Open?%      SERIAL('Open?')% provides help on the Open function.% % You can use SERIAL with multiple ports. Open ports are unavailable% to others, so close them when you're done. SERIAL keeps an internal % list of its open ports and automatically closes them all if it's % flushed or MATLAB is terminated.% % Supported baud rates: 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 3600, 4800,% 7200, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, 115000, 230000.%% You can control many of the configuration parameters, including% two of the handshaking lines (DTR and RTS). See SERIAL Params.% Let us know if you need more control over handshaking.% % TROUBLESHOOTING: When making a custom cable to connect your serial% port to another device, e.g. a photometer, it usually won't work% until you get all the connections right. (Alas, there are certain% lines that must be held high or low for anything to work.) Figuring% out what's wrong is a bit tricky. The link to our Tips web site below% will lead you to Brian Cole's quick guide to making a serial cable,% Jim Conner's thorough explanation what all the serial port wires do,% and let you download two serial-port debugging utilities (Serial of% Champions and Keyboard2Serial).% % web http://vision.nyu.edu/Tips/HowTo.html#UseSerial% % See SerialTest.m.% 9/18/98  dhb  Wrote it.% 8/31/99  dhb  Enhancements comment.% 9/1/99   dgp  Added link to Tips web site.% 9/11/99  dgp  Cosmetic.% 10/27/99 dhb  Added note about close-order bug.% 2/21/00  dgp  Removed close-order bug note, since it's fixed.
