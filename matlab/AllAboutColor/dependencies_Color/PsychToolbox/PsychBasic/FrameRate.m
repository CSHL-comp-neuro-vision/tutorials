function hz=FrameRate(w)% hz = FrameRate(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)% % FrameRate immediately returns the monitor's frame rate, in Hz. If% windowPtrOrScreenNumber is an array, then "hz" will be an array of% the same size, with frame rates for each window/screen.% % FrameRate simply returns SCREEN(w,'FrameRate'). This instantly% returns the frame rate last measured by SCREEN for that screen (eg% when you first opened a window on that screen or forced a% measurement).  If you manually change the frame rate (eg using the% Monitors control panel), the old value cached by SCREEN FrameRate% will be stale, so you should flush everything, eg CLEAR SCREEN, or% force SCREEN to remeasure it by calling SCREEN(w,'FrameRate',NaN).% % Also see ScreenTest, BlankingInterruptRate, "SCREEN FrameRate?", and% DriverTest.% % Denis Pelli% 14 July 1998 dgp wrote it.% 10/3/99 dgp Removed all the fancy testing code, to create the new DriverTest.m.if nargin~=1 | nargout>1 | isempty(w) | ~isa(w,'double') | isnan(w)	error('Usage: hz=FrameRate(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)');end% w is arrayhz=zeros(size(w));for i=1:length(w(:))	% This SCREEN function is instantaneous, returning the value from an old measurement.	hz(i)=SCREEN(w(i),'FrameRate');end
