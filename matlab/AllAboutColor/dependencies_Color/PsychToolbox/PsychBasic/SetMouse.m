function SetMouse% SetMouse(x,y,[windowPtrOrScreenNumber])% % Move the mouse cursor to the passed (x,y) position.%% The cursor position (x,y) is "local", i.e. relative to the origin of the% window or screen, if supplied. Otherwise it's "global", i.e. relative to% the origin of the main screen (the one with the menu bar).% % After calling SetMouse, there's a short period (until the next tick?)% during which GetMouse reports the old position, after which it reports% the new position. To be conservative, you can code as follows:%  while 1%    SetMouse(theX,theY);%    [checkX,checkY] = GetMouse;%    if (checkX==theX) & (checkY==theY)%	   break;%    end%  end%% Cursor updating is usually carried out by a System task that runs once% per tick, so it's likely that SetMouse doesn't take effect until the% next tick. Instead of the elaborate check suggested above, it might% be enough, after calling SetMouse, to simply WaitTicks(1) before calling% GetMouse to be sure of getting the new position.% 6/7/96  dhb Wrote it.% 8/23/96 dhb Added support for windowInfo argument.% 3/23/97 dgp Updated.% 8/14/97 dhb Added comment about delay.% 8/15/97 dgp Suggest WaitTicks(1).
