function oldOn=FileShare(on,askBeforeChange)% oldOn=FileShare([on],[askBeforeChange])% % Control file sharing.  Gets current status before call.  If the "on"% argument is passed (-1,-2,or -3), sets filesharing accordingly. If% boolean "askBeforeChange" is 1, then we explicitly ask the user for% permission in all questionable cases.  Thus%   oldOn=FileShare(-3,1);%   ...%   FileShare(oldOn)% is a fairly conservative way to control filesharing during execution% of your experiments.  When writing programs that other people may% run, we suggest using this form.  Let us know if it fails to handle% any cases reasonably.% % oldOn:%   -3 means off or not supported.%   -2 means starting up.%   -1 means on.% n>=0 means scheduled to shut down in n minutes.% % on:%   -3 means turn off.%   -2 means turn on.%   -1 means turn on.%   any other passed value is ignored (default).% % askBeforeChange:% 	0 means no (default)% 	1 means yes% 	any other value is flagged as an error% % NOTE: We have only tested this routine with Personal Fileshare% (which is included in Mac OS 7 and later), not with Appleshare (the% server software you can buy separately).  It should work with% Appleshare, but there are some message pointers that are irrelevant% with Filesharing that may matter with Appleshare. We think we set% them up properly, but we couldn't test it. Would anyone want to run% experiments on their Appleshare server?% % FS.mex does the work, but has an ugly user interface.% 3/4/97  dhb  Wrote it at suggestion of dgp.% 3/20/97 dhb  Modifications for fuller status reporting.%         dhb  Added ask before change.% 3/24/97 dhb  Initialize ok properly.% 1/13/98 dgp  Changed "was" to "is", because I found the past tense confusing.% 9/26/99 dgp  Cosmetic.if nargout>1 | nargin>2	fprintf('Usage: oldOn=FileShare([on],[askBeforeChange])');endoldOn=FS('Check');ok=1;if nargin<2	askBeforeChange=0;endif nargin>0	if on==-1 | on==-2		if askBeforeChange			if oldOn==-3				ok=input('Filesharing is off.
