Each column of the matrix is treated% as one color plane with spatial dimensions N by N.  The order of% color planes is red, green, blue.  The data in each color plane% should be between 0 and 1.  Within a color plane, the data are% packed with row as the inner index.   This is consistent with% the way MATLAB stores its matrices. %% Because of the convention used to extract dimensions from the% passed matrix, all images are shown as square.  Indeed, funny% things will happen if you pass a matrix whose column dimension% is not a perfect square.%% Control returns to MATLAB when all of the windows have been closed.% You cannot leave an image up and continue on in the MATLAB command window.% 8/19/94		dhb		Link in new version of pixel handling code.% 7/11/00		dgp		Note obsolescence.
