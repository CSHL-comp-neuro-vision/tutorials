function InsertBitImage% InsertBitImage(image,bitImage,i)%% MEX file to convert a matrix image to an 8 bit image% and insert it into a sequence of images to be played by% SCREEN('BlitBitImage',...);%% 'image' is an m by n image to be inserted into 'bitImage' as% image number i in the sequence.  'image' should have values% in the range 0 to 1.%% NOTE: Unlike typical MATLAB routines, InsertBitImage% changes 'bitImage', rather than returning a new matrix.%% NOTE: 'bitImage' should be initialized in advance by calling% ZeroBitImage.  Do not allocate it by hand -- the algorithm% for choosing the size is very tricky.%% NOTE: Do not try to interpret bitImage numbers in MATLAB, since% MATLAB will interpret the entries as doubles.% 6/7/95	gmb, dhb	Cleaned a little bit.% 6/13/95	dhb			Updated to emphasize use of ZeroBitImage.
