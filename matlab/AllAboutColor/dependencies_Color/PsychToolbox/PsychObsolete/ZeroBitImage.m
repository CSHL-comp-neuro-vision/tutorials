The MEX file calculates the size correctly, taking into% account the weirdnesses of pixel alignment in GWorld bitmaps.% % Note that imageSize = [m,n] should contain the row and column% dimensions of the image.  These may be obtained by setting% imageSize = size(X) where X is a MATLAB matrix with the same size% as the image.  Do not use imageSize = size(bitMap) where bitMap is% a previously constructed bitmap of the image.% 6/7/95	gmb, dhb	Cleaned up a little.% 6/13/95	dhb       Turned into a MEX file.% 8/21/95	dhb				Say more about imageSize as per Debbie Moore's suggestion.% 7/11/00		dgp		  Note obsolescence.
