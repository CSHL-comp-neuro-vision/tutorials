function err = SndPlay(sound,rate)% err = SndPlay([sound],[rate])% % SndPlay is obsolete. Please use SND.mex instead. In order not to break old% programs, this M file implements the old SndPlay by calling SND. % However, we suggest you update your programs to take advantage of% the superior features of SND.% % SndPlay(sound) plays a sound on a Macintosh. Unlike MATLAB's SOUND% command, SndPlay returns immediately, while the sound is still playing.% The sound may either be a numeric array of samples, or a string giving% the name of a Macintosh snd resource in the System file (or MATLAB% application or MEX file). Any sound currently playing is immediately % displaced by the new sound.% % SndPlay(0) stops all sound immediately.% % SndPlay with no arguments waits until all the sounds in the channel play% through.% % The "sound" data should lie between -1 and 1. If the sound array has one% row then it's played monaurally. If it has two rows then it's played in% stereo. % % The sample "rate" defaults to the standard Macintosh hardware sample% rate of 22254.545454 Hz. Other values can be specified (in the range% 1000 to 65535 Hz) but linear interpolation is used to resample the data.% Currently the "rate" is ignored when you specify the sound by name.% % SndPlay(sin(0:10000));	% play 7 kHz tone% SndPlay([sin(1:20000) zeros(1,10000);zeros(1,10000) sin(1:20000)]); % stereo% SndPlay('Quack');			% play named snd resource% % See SND.% % Denis Pelli February 6, 1998% % NOTE: SndPlay(sound) always immediately stopped whatever sound was% playing (closing and reopening the channel) before playing the new% sound. This was necessary to work around a bug in the pre-version-3% Sound Manager. Based on enhancements to the underlying VideoToolbox% routine, the new SND(sound) leaves the existing channel open, including% whatever sounds are in the queue, and politely adds your new sound to% the end of the queue. This is much better: SND returns quickly, and% allows you to accurately play many sounds back-to-back. However, since% the purpose of this file is compatibility, we simulate the% sound-terminating behavior of SndPlay by calling:% SND('Quiet');SND(sound);% 6/6/96	dgp Wrote it.% 6/1/97	dgp Polished help text.% 12/10/97	dhb Updated help.% 2/4/98	dgp Revised it to be based on SND.mex.if nargin==0	err=SND('Wait');	return;enderr=SND('Quiet');switch nargincase 1;	err=SND('Play',sound);	return;case 2;	err=SND('Play',sound,rate);	return;end
