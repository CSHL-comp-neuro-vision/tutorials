Image values% should be in range [0,1].% % Each column of vecs is assumed to represent a color image stacked% into a vector.  This is a convenient format for some image% processing techniques.% % If nRowPixels and nColPixels are omitted, the image is assumed to% be square.% % Control returns to MATLAB when all of the windows have been closed.% You cannot leave an image up and continue on in the MATLAB command% window.% % 8/19/94		dhb		Wrote it.% 7/11/00		dgp		Note obsolescence.
