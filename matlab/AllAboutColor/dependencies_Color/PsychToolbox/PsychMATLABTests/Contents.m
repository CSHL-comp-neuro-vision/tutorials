We've reported% all of them to Mathworks (the Case numbers are included), but% Mathworks isn't developing MATLAB for Mac at present, so no fixes% are expected unless they decide at some future date to resume% support for the Mac platform. Note that MATLAB 5.2.1 is the% best-ever release of MATLAB for the Mac, and runs very well on Mac% OS 8 and 9. And we expect it to run well in the "Classic"% application environment of Mac OS X.% web http://www.apple.com/macosx/% % ConcatenationBug       - Square and curly braces sometimes can't embrace multiple lines. 84454% fprintfBug             - FPRINTF may interpret the first argument as a filename. 201530% fprintfEmpty           - FPRINTF terminates when it gets an empty matrix []. 297266% fprintfLeak            - FPRINTF leaks memory (i.e. uses up the Temp memory heap). 319124% helpLinelength         - HELP terminates if a line exceeds 131 characters. 41758% iminfoBuglet           - IMINFO gives misleading error message. 187040% SpuriousDebuggerError  - The debugger works, but gives a spurious error message. 230201% StaleDirectoryCacheBug - MATLAB's directory cache is not updated when you add files to /toolbox/. 230202% ylabelBug              - YLABEL command (in MATLAB plots) bug and work around. 297565% Copyright (c) 2000 by David Brainard & Denis Pelli
