DECRIPTION

This package contains a MatLab implementation of a model for cortical
neurons in visual area MT, as described in detail in the references
given at the bottom of this document.  The model takes as input a
discretized visual stimulus sequence (movie), and computes firing rate
responses of two successive neural populations, corresponding to
direction-selective complex cells in visual area V1, and
"pattern-selective" neurons in area MT.  Further information, as well
the most recent versions of the code, are available at

    http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/MT-model.html

Changes/updates to the software are documented in the ChangeLog file.

Authors:  Timothy Saint and Eero P. Simoncelli

INSTALLATION

1) Download and unpack the folder containing the code.  You can put
   the folder anywhere on your system, but we'll assume it's in a
   folder/directory named "MTmodel".

2) Compile the C code in the mex subfolder.  You should be able to do this 
   by executing "shCompileMex" from within matlab, after setting your path 
   to include the MTmodel folder (see step 0 of next section).

___________________________________________________________________________
USING THE SOFTWARE

0) Start matlab, and put the MTmodel folder in your path:

   addpath(genpath('PATHNAME-OF-MTmodel'));

1) Start by going through the shTutorial1.m file in the "tut"
   folder.  This will show you how to compute responses of various
   stages of the model to any stimulus, and how to generate tuning
   curves.

2) Over time, we will be releasing extensions to the model, as well as 
   addition demonstrations and tutorials.  Check back at
        http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/MT-model.html
   for current status.
