Eye Movement ModelsThe eye movement models are sorted into two groups, Gaze Stabilization movements which include models ofthe vestibulo-ocular reflex and and Gaze ShiftingMovements which include models of the saccadic andpursuit systems. All of these models are constructedusing the simulink toolkit and have the ".mdl" suffixin their file names. To run one of the models type"simulink" at the matlab command prompt. The simulinkmaster palette should appear. Clicking on any of thebuttons will call up a secondary palette of simulinkfunctions. The can be dragged into any "model window"and used as signal sources, displays, or computationalelements. To open a new model window, simply click on"File>New" while any simulink window is active.To open an existing model simply use "File>Open" while any simulink window isactive to open one of the ".mdl" files.(Remember that files of the type "%xxxx.mdl"are backups and will not run is selected.)Finally, if you wish to save ANYTHING that youcreate a new directory BEFORE playing withthe model and save your open model toyour home directory BEFORE starting.
