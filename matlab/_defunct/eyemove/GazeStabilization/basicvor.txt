This directory contains two models of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.The .mdl file named "basicvor" contains a simulink model that roughlyapproximates David A. Robinson's orginal model of the horizontal VOR.The file named "paigevor" contains Gary Paige's (U of Rochester)model of the VOR and OKN. Details can be found in "paigetext". Note thatthis is a MUCH more complex model and that it puts out a desired velocitysignal. This desired rotational velocity signal is NOT passed through amodel of the oculomotor plant.BASICVOR.MDLIt accepts as input either a velocity ramp produced by a simulink pulsegenerator and an integrator or a sinewave velocity input. Switching betweenthese two inputs is accomplished by setting a constant block, that resideswithin "Stimulus" block, to either a zero or a one. The velocity signal is thenpassed through an approximation of the canals and from there to a model"vestibular nucleus". From there the vestibular signal passes into the"velocity storage" feedback loop which serves to lengthen the time constantof the system and also on towards the oculomotor brainstem. Thebrainstem components both pass the canal derived the velocity signaland integrate the velocity signal to produce a position signal. The velocityand position signals are then summed and passed to a model of theeye plant which executes the saccade.When playing with the model, examine the effects of changing the frequencyof a velocity sinewave. Notice how the frequency of oscillation effectsthe gain of the model. It is also interesting to examine the effects ofreducing the gain (to zero?) of the velocity storage system. How does thiseffect performance of the VOR (at low frequencies).
