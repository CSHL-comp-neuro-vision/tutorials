The "PaigeVor.mdl" model is a copy of Gary Paige's (U of Rochester) model of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. It contains a full instantiation of the angular VOR, the linear (or translational) VOR, and the opto-kinetic response. Independent inputs control the rotation of the subject, the presence of backround illumination (to activate the OKN system), and the presence of a visual target (which is important for linear VOR). Finally, elements with in the model set the fixation distance (vergence angle) to control linear/translational VOR effects. Although intimidatingly complete, the model provides an excellent overview of image stabilization systems as they are understood today. This model is know, within the Paige lab, as "canot7" (for canal-otolith7).
