The matlab file "hor_n_vert" contains a complete implementationof a cross-coupled version of the Jurgens model with apair of gradually resetting displacement integrators. Cross-couplingthe horizontal and vertical plants guarantees that the durations of boththe horzontal and vertical components are equivalent. This has the effectof insuring that movements are roughly straight as observed in humanoblique saccades. Note that because the displacement inegratorsaccomplish their reset by a gradual "leak" with a tau of 100 msec,this model cannot produce self-terminating saccades bigger thanabout 25 degrees.
