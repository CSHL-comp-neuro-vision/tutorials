The Robinson model contains a relatively simple version of the saccadic brainstem first proposed by David A. Robinson in the mid-1960s. It takes as an input a single constant that specifies the desired horizontal orbital position of the eye. The model does not produce vertical eye movements, only horizontal eye movements. The saccade itself is initiated by the trigger input. The model includes the original Robinson Neural Integrator, The Saccadic Burst Neurons of the Pons, a Model of the Oculomotor Plant, and the Ropbinson Feedback loop. While more complex instantiations have been implemented, this small model incorporates all of the essential elements of the original Robinson model.To run the model, set an input saccade endpoint into the constant box and thenstart. If you want, you can set the trigger to initiate a second saccade after adelay. In this model, the eye will already have moved to the orbital positionspecified as the saccadic goal and no second saccade will occur. This is verydifferent from the Jurgens model in which the saccadic goal is specified withregard to the current position of the eye at the time of saccade onset.If you examine saccade onset you will also observe a velocity saturation(as occurs in humans and monkeys). As saccade amplitude increases, velocityincreases to a point and then saturates. Messing with the saturating exponentialthat simulates the excitatory burst neurons of the brainstem will eliminatethis feature to some extent but remember that the plant serves as an unavoidablelow pass filter.One final experiment of interest is to turn off either the neural integrator or theburst gain. Then the system will produce either a pulse of velocity with anexponential decay to the primary position (burst only) or an exponential decayto the desired position (integrator only).
