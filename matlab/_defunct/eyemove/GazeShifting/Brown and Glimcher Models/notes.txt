I'veincluded several sample experiment scripts. You'll need to change the PATH variable or move everything into one directory to runthe scripts.Movements are specified using "From Workspace"  simulink modules (goinside Movement Specifier). Define matrices hspec, vspec, andtrigspec in the matlab workspace to specifiy desired horizontal amp,desired vertical amp, and trigger, as a function of time. You can bypass this altogether by using my graphical user interface"gui3.m" in the Library folder. This is convenient for individualsimulations, but does not lend itself to automation. It calls"fastmakeinput.m" to define hspec, vspec, and trigspec. I haven 'tused this for awhile, so I'm not sure what bugs or limitations thereare. These models also contain a "Movement Detector" module, which passesinfo to the movedetect.m matlab function (in Library), which in turndefines global variables in the matlab workspace that store variousmeasurements of the movement.Some models also have an OPN stimulator, which requires thedefinition of the "stimulate" matrix in the matlab workspace. (Oryou can go into the OPN module and delete it).MODEL BUGLockingLeak.m and MagicBox.m contain an error. The omnipause-neuroninhibition of the medium-lead burst neurons is incorrectlyimplemented. (Go inside the burster modules. OPNs input should besubtracted from Motor Error instead of from the exponentialmultiplier).This problem is corrected in model_continuous, model_delayed, andmodel_gated.
