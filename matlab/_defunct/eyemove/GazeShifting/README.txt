The "classic models" folder contains working instantiations of the original Robinson and Jurgens models of the saccadic system.  The folder labeled "Brown and Glimcher" contains more complete models derived from the Jurgen system, and first proposed by Nichols and Sparks. While quite complete, incorporating vertical and horizontally cross-coupled movements, and many other features, many of these models simply do not perform well. This reflects limitations of the Jurgen-type architecture and may be of interest to students developing their own models of the saccadic brainstem.
