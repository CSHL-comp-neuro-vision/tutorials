Hello! This short demo was designed to let you visualize some data that I recorded in Dr Cullen''s lab. It also shows you the results of two analysis approaches that were applied to this data. To make this a little more challenging, I will ask you, based on the results of both approaches, to decide if this neuron better encoded the motion of the gaze or the motion of the eye. Do both methods agree? If not, why? Which one will give you the most accurate answer?   Good luck, Pierre A. SylvestreThis demo shows two different ways of fitting motor neurons firing rates to eye and/or head position during saccades. It was meant to resolve a controversy bewteen the Cullen Fuchs labs over two papers that appeared in the Journal of Neuroscience (2000).  It was contributed to the course by Kathy Cullen in 2002.
