function z = zscore(d)%  ZSCORE Standardized z score.%   Z = ZSCORE(D) returns the deviation of each column of D from its mean %   normalized by its standard deviation. This is known as the Z score of D.%   For a column vector V, z score is Z = (V-mean(V))./std(V)%%   ZSCORE is commonly used to preprocess data before computing distances for %   cluster analysis.%%   See also PDIST, CLUSTER, CLUSTERDATA.[m,n] = size(d);if m == 1   m = n;   d = d';endmd = repmat(mean(d),m,1);sd = repmat(std(d),m,1);sd(sd==0) = 1; % all the numerator will be zero in such case.z = (d-md)./sd;
