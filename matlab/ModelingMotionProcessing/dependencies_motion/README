Code in this directory implements 2D and 3D versions of multiscale
affine image registration, like that described by Bergen et al.,
"Hierarchical model-based motion estimation" in Proceedings of Second
European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer-Verlag, p. 237-252,
1992.

motion.ps provides a detailed description of the algorithm (and
related approaches).

A good place to start is by looking at the examples near the bottom of
estAffineMulti2.m and estAffineMulti3.m.
