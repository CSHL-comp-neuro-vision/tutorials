% Stanford filtering tools
%
% blur - blurs an image by blurring and subsampling repeatedly,
%      followed by upsampling and blurring.
% cconv2 - circular convolution (calls upConv)
% cconv2sep - separable, circular, convolution (calls upConv)
% conv2sep - separable convolution using conv2
% dx - x-derivative of an image
% dxx - 2nd x-derivative 
% dxy - cross-derivative
% dy - y-derivative
% dyy - 2nd y-derivative
% flowlineCurvature - 2nd-order derivative-based measures that is
%      invariant to any monotonic intensity nonlinearity
% gradientMag - gradient magnitude of an image
% isophoteCurvature - 2nd-order derivative-based measures that is
%      invariant to any monotonic intensity nonlinearity
% rconv2 - convolution with reflection at edges (calls upConv)
% rconv2sep - separable, convolution using reflecting edge
%      handler (calls upConv).
