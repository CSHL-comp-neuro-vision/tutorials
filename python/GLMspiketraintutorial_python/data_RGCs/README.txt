DATA:
-----

The dataset contains spike responses from 2 ON and 2 OFF parasol retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) in primate retina, stimulated with a non-repeating
full-field binary white noise stimulus for 20 minutes.

Files:
-----
Stim.mat      % binary white noise stimulus (presented at ~120 Hz framerate).
SpTimes.mat   % Spike times from four neurons (in units of stim frames).
                       % Neurons #1-2 are OFF, #3-4 are ON cells.
stimtimes.mat   % Stimulus frame times in seconds (if desired).
